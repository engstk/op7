Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Diagnostic Services

Diag is used for generating Diagnostic Packets (F3s, Logs and Events) from the application
processor. It also support sending and receiving commands/responses to/from the target.
Diag will also communicate with MDM through either USB or HSIC bridge. This node will decide
which interface diag need to choose to communicate with MDM. This node will enable USB as the
bridge interface otherwise diag will choose HSIC (MHI) as the default bridge interface.

Required properties:
-compatible: should be "qcom,diag"
-qcom,usb-enabled: this will enable usb as the bridge interface for diag
		   to communicate with remote peripheral.

Example:

	qcom,diag {
		compatible = "qcom,diag";
		qcom,usb-enabled;
	};
