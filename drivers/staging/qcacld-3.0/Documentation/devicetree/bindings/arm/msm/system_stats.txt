* System sleep stats

Resource Power manager maintains information about system sleep and the time
each master spent in respective sleep modes. These were previously exported
through two modules, one for system and another for the respective master
votes. The two modules are now combined into a system stats drivers to provide
better visibility into system sleep modes.
