Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SDE KMS LEASE

Snapdragon Display Engine Lease registers with the Linux DRM/KMS framework to
facilitate DRM driver creation, publishing /dev/dri/card<n>, n=1,2,... from
card0 with objects implicitly leased.

This device must be added to the connectors list of qcom,sde-kms device.

Required properties
- compatible: Must be "qcom,sde-kms-lease".

Optional properties
- qcom,lease-connectors: Connector names leased to the card.
- qcom,lease-planes: Plane names leased to the card.
- qcom,dev-name: Name of the lease device.

If there are cards with qcom,lease-connectors and/or qcom,lease-planes not
defined, the last one with empty connectors and/or planes in the connectors
list of qcom,sde-kms device will have all the remaining connectors and/or
planes that are not leased to other cards.

Example:
	card1: qcom,sde-kms-lease@0 {
		compatible = "qcom,sde-kms-lease";
		qcom,dev-name = "msm_drm1";
		qcom,lease-connectors = "DSI-1";
		qcom,lease-planes = "plane-0", "plane-8";
	};

	card2: qcom,sde-kms-lease@1 {
		compatible = "qcom,sde-kms-lease";
		qcom,dev-name = "msm_drm2";
		qcom,lease-connectors = "DSI-2";
		qcom,lease-planes = "plane-1", "plane-9";
	};
