* GIC EDAC node:

GIC EDAC node is defined to describe on-chip error or fault detection and correction
for GIC RAM. GICT(GIC trace and debug) register map describes the syndrome information
and GICT support is available from GIC-600 onwards.

GIC EDAC reports all Single Bit Error and Double Bit Error found in GIC RAM.
Current GIC ECC implementation is interrupt based. GIC scrub feature helps
to avoid potential errors accumulation of particular error location by a write-back
of all valid RAM entries periodically.

GICT identifies software programming errors, correctable and uncorrectable
errors of Shared Peripheral Interrupt(SPI) RAM, Software Generated Interrupt(SGI) RAM,
Private Peripheral Interrupt(PPI) RAM, Locality-Specific Peripheral Interrupt(LPI) RAM
and Interrupt Translation Service (ITS) RAM.
For every error record following information available -
	ERRXSTATUS - Error Record Status Register
	ERRXMISC0 - Error Record Miscellaneous Register 0
	ERRXMISC1 - Error Record Miscellaneous Register 1
	ERRXADDR  - Error Record Address Resister

The following section describes the DT node binding for gic-erp.

Required properties:
- compatible		: "arm,gic-600-erp".
- reg-names		: GIC Trace, GIC Distributor, GIC Redistributor bases
- interrupt-config	: SPI interrupt numbers of Fault and Error interrupts
			  to configure GICT_ERRORQCR0, GICT_ERRORQCR1 registers respectively.
- interrupts		: Interrupts for Fault and Error IRQs

gict: gict@17a20000 {
	compatible = "arm,gic-600-erp";
	reg = <0x17a20000 0x10000>;	/* GICT */
	reg-names = "gict-base";
	interrupt-config = <46, 17>;
	interrupt-names = "gict-fault", "gict-err";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 46 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 17 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
