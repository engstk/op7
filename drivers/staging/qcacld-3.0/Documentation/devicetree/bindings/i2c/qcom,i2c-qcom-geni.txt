GENI based Qualcomm Technologies Inc Universal Peripheral version 3 (QUPv3)
								I2C controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be:
   * "qcom,i2c-geni.
 - reg: Should contain QUP register address and length.
 - interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.
 - clocks: Serial engine core clock, and AHB clocks needed by the device.
 - pinctrl-names/pinctrl-0/1: The GPIOs assigned to this core. The names
   should be "active" and "sleep" for the pin confuguration when core is active
   or when entering sleep state.
 - #address-cells: Should be <1> Address cells for i2c device address
 - #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component
 - qcom,wrapper-core: Wrapper QUPv3 core containing this I2C controller.

Optional property:
 - qcom,clk-freq-out: Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
   When missing default to 400000Hz.
 - qcom,clk-cfg: Array of <u32>, clk cfg array should have 2nd to 5th parameter as
   suggested by hardware expert. Standard frequency parameters taken cared by the
   driver itself. This field is needed only if client freq is not from the i2c standard
   supported frequencies or to fine tune the existing clock parameters.
   1st parameter: clk-freq-out, desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
   2nd parameter: clk_div, desired I2C bus divider value.
   3rd parameter: t_high, desired HIGH period of SCL clock.
   4th parameter: t_low, desired LOW period of SCL clock.
   5th parameter: t_cycle, desired clock cycle.

   Note: Both qcom,clk-freq-out and qcom,clk-cfg should not be specified at the same time.

Child nodes should conform to i2c bus binding.

Example:

i2c@a94000 {
	compatible = "qcom,i2c-geni";
	reg = <0xa94000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 358 0>;
	clock-names = "se-clk", "m-ahb", "s-ahb";
	clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP0_S5_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_M_AHB_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_S_AHB_CLK>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qup_1_i2c_5_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qup_1_i2c_5_sleep>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	qcom,wrapper-core = <&qupv3_0>;
	qcom,clk-freq-out = <400000>;
	qcom,clk-cfg = <400000 2 5 12 24>; //optional to qcom,clk-freq-out
};
