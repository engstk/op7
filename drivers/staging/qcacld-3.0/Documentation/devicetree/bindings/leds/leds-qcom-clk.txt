Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. clock controller based PWM driver
-------------------------------------------------------------

Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. provides clock controller to be connected to LED
to generate PWM. This driver can configure duty-cycle of clock to get the
required brightness. The complete clock duty-cycle is 100 and brightness is
denoted by the period in which signal is active or high.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "qcom,clk-led-pwm".
- clock_names: Should be "core".
- clocks: Should contain the phandle of the source clock.
- assgined-clocks: Phandle of the source clock.
- assinged-clock-rates: Desired frequency of the source clock.
- qcom,max_duty: Maximum duty cycle that can be set on the clock.
		   Should be less than 100.
- pinctrl-names: Property should contain "active" and "sleep" for the
		   pin configurations during the usecase and during idle.
- pinctrl-x: phandle to the default/sleep pin configurations.

Optional properties:
- qcom,label: Label for the sysfs node.


Example:

qcom_clk_led {
	compatible = "qcom,clk-led-pwm";
	qcom,label = "led_clk_pwm";
	qcom,max_duty = <80>;
	clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_GP2_CLK>;
	clock-names = "core";
	assigned-clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_GP2_CLK>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <80000>;
	pinctrl-names = "active", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qcom_clk_led_gp2_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qcom_clk_led_gp2_sleep>;
};

qcom_clk_led_gp2_pins: qcom_clk_led_gp2_pins {
	qcom_clk_led_gp2_active: qcom_clk_led_gp2_active {
		mux {
			pins = "gpio21";
			function = "gcc_gp2";
		};

		config {
			pins = "gpio21";
			drive-strength = <2>;
			bias-disable;
		};
	};

	qcom_clk_led_gp2_sleep: qqcom_clk_led_gp2_sleep {

			pins = "gpio21";
			function = "gpio";
		};

		config {
			pins = "gpio21";
			drive-strength = <2>;
			bias-pull-down;
		};
	};
};
