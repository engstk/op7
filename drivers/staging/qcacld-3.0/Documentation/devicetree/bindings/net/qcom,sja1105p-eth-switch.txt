* NXP SJA1105P 10/100/1000 Ethernet Switch Driver

Required properties:
### Properties of top level
- compatible: Should be "qcom,nxp,sja1105p-switch".
- reg: Should contain SPI chip select.
- spi-max-frequency: Should contain maximum spi clock frequency
  for slave device.
- spi-cpha: SPI configuration to enable shift clock phase (CPHA) mode.
- switch-speed: Should contain switch ports speed 10/100/1000 Mbps.
- pinctrl-names : Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states
- pinctrl-<n> : Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
- qcom,reset-gpio: Reference to the GPIO connected to the reset input.

### Properties of the port-X child node
- `null-phy`: Determines if the port has a PHY connected to it or not
- `phy-ref`: _phandle_ to the connected ethernet PHY
   **NOTE**: Must be `0x00` in case there is no PHY connected to port-X
   (for example if port-X is a host port or a cascaded port)
- `logical-port-num`: logical port number, used for the port mapping
   **NOTE**: Must be `0xff` in case port-X is a cascaded port.

Example:

	sja1105: ethernet-switch@0{
		compatible = "qcom,nxp,sja1105p-switch";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <12000000>;
		spi-cpha;
		switch-speed = <1000>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sja1105_default>;
		qcom,reset-gpio = <&tlmm 91 0x1>;

		port-0 {
			null-phy = <0x1>;
			phy-ref = < 0 >;
			logical-port-num = < 0 >;
		};

		port-1 {
			null-phy = <0x1>;
			phy-ref = < 0 >;
			logical-port-num = < 1 >;
		};

		port-2 {
			null-phy = <0x1>;
			phy-ref = < 0 >;
			logical-port-num = < 2 >;
		};

		port-3 {
			null-phy = <0x1>;
			phy-ref = < 0 >;
			logical-port-num = < 3 >;
		};

		port-4 {
			null-phy = <0x1>;
			phy-ref = < 0 >;
			logical-port-num = < 4 >;
		};
	};
