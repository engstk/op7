AQT1000 audio CODEC

Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,aqt1000-i2c-codec" for AQT1000 Codec

- qcom,aqt-rst-gpio-node: Phandle reference to the DT node having codec reset gpio
                          configuration. If this property is not defined,
                          codec will not get registered.

- reg: Address of the codec. If this property is not defined then I2C will
       not be able to get AQT1000 address.

- qcom,cdc-static-supplies: Static VREG_BOB Supply for AQT1000 codec.
                            All other supplies are derived from this.
                            If this property is not defined,
                            codec will not power up.

-qcom,cdc-micbias1-mv: micbias1 output voltage in milli volts.
                       This is used when cfilt is not user configurable
                       and micbias1 is directly controlled with a register
                       write.
-qcom,cdc-ext-clk-rate: External clock frequency used for AQT1000.
                        All internal clocks for AQT1000 are derived from this clock.
                        If this property is not defined then default external
                        clock rate of 9.6M will be provided.
-qcom,cdc-mclk-clk-rate: Specifies the master clock rate in Hz required for
                         codec.
-qcom,aqt-irq: Phandle reference to DT node having codec interrupt gpio
               configuration. If this property is not defined,
               interrupt will not be enabled.

- clock-names : clock name defined for external clock.
- clocks : external clock defined for codec clock.

- interrupt-controller : Mark this device node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Should be 1
- interrupt-parent : Parent interrupt controller
- qcom,gpio-connect: GPIO that connects to parent interrupt controller

- pinctrl-names: Pinctrl state names for each pin group configuration.
- pinctrl-x: Defines pinctrl state for each pin group.

Optional properties:

- cdc-vdd-rxtx-supply: phandle of rxtx supply's regulator device tree node.
- qcom,cdc-vdd-rxtx-voltage: rxtx supply's voltage level min and max in mV.
- qcom,cdc-vdd-rxtx-current: rxtx supply's max current in mA.

- cdc-vdd-buck-supply: phandle of buck supply's regulator device tree node.
- qcom,cdc-vdd-buck-voltage: buck supply's voltage level min and max in mV.
- qcom,cdc-vdd-buck-current: buck supply's max current in mA.

- cdc-vdd-vbat-supply: phandle of vbat supply's regulator device tree node.
- qcom,cdc-vdd-vbat-voltage: vbat supply's voltage level min and max in mV.
- qcom,cdc-vdd-vbat-current: vbat supply's max current in mA.
