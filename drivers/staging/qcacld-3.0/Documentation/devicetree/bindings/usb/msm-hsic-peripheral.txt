USB HSIC Peripheral:

This describes device tree node for the USB HSIC Peripheral. This works with
usage of USB Device controller to enable USB HSIC Device mode functionality.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,hsic-peripheral"
- regs : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" is "vdd" and optional "GDSC".
- qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
  values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
  microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner.

Optional properties :
- qcom,usb-id-core: USB Core Index to be used to bind with gadget driver.
- qcom,hsic-tlmm-init-seq: HSIC TLMM PADS initialization sequence with
  reg, value pairs.
- reg : offset and length of the register set in the memory map.
  This is required if 'qcom,hsic-tlmm-init-seq' is specified.
- qcom,hsic-disable-on-boot: If present then HSIC is suspended on bootup
  and user can enable this using sysfs if HSIC host is present.
Example USB HSIC device node :
	hsic: hsic@f9a15000 {
		compatible = "qcom,hsic-peripheral";
		reg = <0xf9a15000 0x352>,
		      <0x01112000 0xc>;
		interrupts = <0 136 0>;
		qcom,usb-id-core = <1>;
		vdd-supply = <&pmd9635_l2>;
		GDSC-supply = <&gdsc_usb_hsic>;
		qcom,vdd-voltage-level = <0 1200000 1200000>;
		qcom,hsic-tlmm-init-seq =
			<0x8 0x5 0x4 0x5 0x0 0x1>;
		qcom,hsic-disable-on-boot;
	};
