GNSS Driver for SiRFStar Chip
=============================

Description:
This is a driver to handle SiRFStar GNSS chip power controls, a device node
is created to interact with driver power controls and exposes set of IOCTLs.
These IOCTLs provide mechanisms to transition of GNSS receiver power state.

GPIO Usage:
  probe will provide GPIO pins information to driver to control GNSS power

Device Node Creation:
 A device node is will be created as /dev/gnss_sirf

Device Node Usage:
 Device node /dev/gnss_sirf can be used to control ON_OFF & RESET pins of
 SiRFStar GNSS receiver using exposed IOCTLS
