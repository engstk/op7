NOTES about msm drm/kms hyp driver:

This driver registers with drm framework for the purpose of creating the
/dev/dri/card0 path, which User Space DRM masters rely on.
Furthermore, per-CRTC VBLANK and PAGE_FLIP events are queued to the device
path to notify User Space components listeners.

No other IOCTL or HW support is provided through this driver.
