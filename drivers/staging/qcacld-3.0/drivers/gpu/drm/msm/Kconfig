	  MSM platform is MDP4 based.

config DRM_MSM_HDCP
	tristate "HDCP for MSM DRM"
	depends on DRM_MSM
	default n
	help
	  Chose this option if High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP)
	  support is needed in the MSM DRM/KMS driver.  Enabling this config
	  will allow HDCP encrypted (copy protected) media to be displayed.
	  This should only be enabled if required for platforms supporting HDCP
	  over the desired interface.

config DRM_SDE_WB
	bool "Enable Writeback support in SDE DRM"
	depends on DRM_MSM
	default y
	help
	  Choose this option for writeback connector support.
	  This option enables a virtual writeback connector where
	  the output image is written back to memory in the format
	  selected by the connector's mode and property settings.

config DRM_SDE_SHD
	bool "Enable Shared display support in SDE DRM"
	depends on DRM_MSM
	help
	  Choose this option for shared display support.
	  This option enables multiple logical displays
	  to share one base physical encoder/connector.

	  connectors and report back to user.

config DRM_SDE_SHP
	bool "Enable Shared plane support in SDE DRM"
	depends on DRM_MSM
	help
	  Choose this option for shared plane support.
	  This option enables multiple logical planes

	help
	  The SDE DRM debugging provides support to enable display debugging
	  features to: dump SDE registers during driver errors, panic
	  driver during fatal errors and enable some display-driver logging
	  into an internal buffer (this avoids logging overhead).

config DRM_SDE_RSC
	bool "Enable sde resource state coordinator(rsc) driver"
	depends on DRM_MSM
	help
	  The SDE DRM RSC provides display Resource State Coordinator support
	  to vote the ab/ib bandwidth for primary display. Each rsc client
	  can vote their active state. Any active request from any client
	  avoids the display core power collapse. A client can also register
	  for display core power collapse events on rsc.
