	  The TCSR compute signal module provides hgsl driver
	  in hypervisor Linux a way to send/receive signals
	  to/from A6x GPU hardware directly, without going
	  through host system.

	depends on QTI_GVM
	depends on QCOM_HGSL_TCSR_SIGNAL
	help
	  This driver could help commands submmitting functions for
	  hypervisor Linux. With HFI feature provided by A6x, it
	  could submit commands directly to hardware without passing
	  them to host system.
