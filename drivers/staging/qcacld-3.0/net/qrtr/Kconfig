# Qualcomm IPC Router configuration
#

config QRTR
	tristate "Qualcomm IPC Router support"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	---help---
	  Say Y if you intend to use Qualcomm IPC router protocol.  The
	  protocol is used to communicate with services provided by other
	  hardware blocks in the system.

	  In order to do service lookups, a userspace daemon is required to
	  maintain a service listing.

if QRTR

config QRTR_NODE_ID
	int "QRTR Local Node ID"
	default 1
	---help---
	  This option is used to configure the QRTR Node ID for the local
	  processor. The node ID published to other nodes within the system.
	  This value can be overridden by the name service application. This
	  option is for configurations where Node ID needs to be customized
	  but the name service application is not priveleged enough to use
	  netlink sockets.

config QRTR_SMD
	tristate "SMD IPC Router channels"
	depends on RPMSG || (COMPILE_TEST && RPMSG=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support SMD based ipcrouter channels.  SMD is the
	  most common transport for IPC Router.

config QRTR_MHI
	tristate "MHI IPC Router channels"
	depends on MHI_BUS || (COMPILE_TEST && MHI_BUS=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support MHI based ipcrouter channels.  MHI is the
	  transport used for external modem connections for IPC Router.

config QRTR_USB
	tristate "USB IPC Router channels"
	depends on USB || (COMPILE_TEST && USB=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support USB based ipcrouter channels.

config QRTR_FIFO
	tristate "FIFO IPC Router channels"
	---help---
	Say Y here to support FIFO based ipcrouter channels. FIFO Transport
	Layer enables IPC Router communication between two virtual machines.

config QRTR_MHI_DEV
	tristate "MHI Device IPC Router channels"
	depends on MSM_MHI_DEV || (COMPILE_TEST && MSM_MHI_DEV=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support MHI base ipcrouter channels for device
	  endpoint mode.  MHI is the transport used for external modem
	  connections.  This driver enables QRTR to run on the modem device
	  side.

config QRTR_USB_DEV
	tristate "USB Device IPC Router channels"
	depends on USB_CONFIGFS_F_IPC || (COMPILE_TEST && USB_CONFIGFS_F_IPC=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support USB device based ipcrouter channels.
	  This driver enables QRTR to run on the modem device.

config QRTR_ETHERNET
	tristate "Ethernet IPC Router channel"
	help
	  Say Y here to support Ethernet based ipcrouter channels. Ethernet
	  is the transport used for external auto connections for IPC router.
	  This has an out-of-tree dependency on ethernet adaption layer.
